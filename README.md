Password complexity plays an important role in strengthening security. 
Complex passwords—those that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and sufficient length—are significantly harder for attackers to guess or crack. 
High complexity increases the total number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks time-consuming and less effective. 
It also reduces the chances of being compromised through dictionary attacks, because the password is not based on common words or predictable patterns. 
Therefore, greater password complexity directly enhances protection and lowers the risk of unauthorized access.
research:
1. Brute-Force Attack
A brute-force attack is a method where an attacker tries every possible combination of characters to guess a password.
It is a trial-and-error technique that becomes highly time-consuming as password length and complexity increase.
Longer passwords with a mix of characters significantly reduce the success rate and speed of brute-force attacks.
2. Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a precompiled list of common words, names, and previously leaked passwords to guess a user’s password.
Instead of attempting random combinations, the attacker tests these likely options, making it faster than brute force when passwords are based on simple or predictable words.
